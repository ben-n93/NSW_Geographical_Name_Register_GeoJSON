# NSW Geographical Name Register - GeoJSON file

The [NSW Geographical Names Board](https://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/) is a government body responsible for the management and administration of geographic place names within the state of New South Wales, Australia.

They very helpfully offer a [CSV file](https://proposals.gnb.nsw.gov.au/public/geonames/search) with all record information from their Geographical Name Register. 

I thought it would be of use to data analysts/scientists/journalists/developers to have a GeoJSON file from this data so I've created this repo. Every day my script downloads the CSV file and outputs it to a GeoJSON file (which you can find in the data directory).

### Acknowledgements

I have to shout out the brilliant [GeoJSON package](https://github.com/jazzband/geojson)!
